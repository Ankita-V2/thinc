Thinc is a **lightweight deep learning library** that offers a minimalistic
design and seamless interoperation with other frameworks. Thinc works especially
well as a glue layer, allowing you to put models defined in
[TensorFlow](/docs/usage-frameworks#tensorflow),
[PyTorch](/docs/usage-frameworks#pytorch) or other libraries behind one **clean,
type-checked API**. You can even wire up hybrid models, making it easy to
migrate code from one framework to another. Thinc also features a great
[configuration solution](/docs/usage-config), helping you keep your work
repeatable and making it easier to ship your models to production.

Previous versions of Thinc have been running quietly in production in thousands
of companies for the last five years: it powers our NLP library
[spaCy](https://spacy.io). However, we always knew the previous versions weren't
quite right, and with lots of frameworks to choose from, we were reluctant to
promote Thinc as an independent solution. Now in 2020, things have changed:
Python 2 is finally dead, and it's time to dance on its grave with a redesign
that really takes advantage of modern Python.
